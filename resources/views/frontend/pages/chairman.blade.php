Dear readers,
As an independent non-profit organisation established and based in Malaysia in early 2016, International Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (IESCO) has the main objective of developing the educational, cultural and scientific sectors of the communities particularly those who are less fortunate living in the conflict zone and poor.<br>
Education is one of the basic needs and everyone has the right to access to education. Children and youth have their own dream to succeed in their future undertaking. The courage of young generation is at the optimum, to contribute to the development of their peaceful and prosperous community. But some of them were trapped in the environment that they themselves do wish to be there such as being poor, under priviledged and in conflict countries. Many have great potentials, determinations, and courages to contribute to free their nation from such condition. Many, even, have dreams of a peaceful world community.<br>
IESCO understands these aspirations and hope of these young, energetic potential leaders. IESCO believes on the strength of cooperation and friendship based in humanity care. Although IESCO is established only a few years ago, it has successfully received support from the government of Malaysia particularly from the Ministry of Education. Many universities in Malaysia has established cooperation through several MoU’s signed during and after our 1st International Conference on Education held on the … January 2018 in Putrajaya, Malaysia which were attended by 300 participants from 22 contries, which represent 15 universities, 10 government representatives, 20 NGO’s and Humanitarian Foundations. IESCO to date successsfully implemented projects related to Education and Scientific researches benefiting children and youth from Palestine, Syria, Rohingya and Yaman. These projects are implemented with the cooperation of universities and NGO’s from Malaysia, Indonesia, Turkey, Palestine, Lubnan, Sudan and Gulf States.<br>
We really hope to strengthen the relationship between Malaysian educational institutions and their counterparts all over the world. We welcome your cooperation and involvement in this noble effort to educate future generations. Thus, hoping to bring peace to the world and progress to humanity.
